To create a new site, run the `new` command with the folder name as an argument. Then, install dependencies and run the development server. Your new site should now be available at [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/).

``` sh
broccoli-taco new my-site
cd my-site && npm install
broccoli-taco serve
```

Now you can start adding pages, assets, and data.
